# dem-printable-obj
Methods for creating printable .obj files from real bivariate functions. The code for this is on a 14-year-old, more-or-less-dead laptop located in another country, so it might be a couple of weeks before I'm able to salvage the hard drive and upload it properly, but I'll upload some photos of the produced objects in the next few days.
